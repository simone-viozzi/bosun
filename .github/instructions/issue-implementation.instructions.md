# Issue Implementation Guidelines

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

## Steps for Effective Implementation

1. Use Serena to understand the project structure and established conventions.
2. Review all memories related to the issue to gather sufficient context.
3. Formulate a high-level plan for implementation, breaking it down into manageable tasks and creating a detailed to-do list.
4. Present your plan for review. Wait for confirmation and approval before proceeding.
5. After receiving approval, implement the plan by following the steps outlined in your to-do list.
6. Stop and ask for clarification if success criteria are unclear or conflicts arise.
7. During the implementation, make extensive use of Serena to navigate the codebase and understand existing patterns.
8. Upon completion, list the Serena memories and evaluate whether any need updating or if new memories should be created.

After each significant step or edit, briefly validate the outcome in 1-2 lines and self-correct if validation fails.
