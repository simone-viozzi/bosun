# Issue Implementation Guidelines

When presented with a structured issue describing a feature or bug fix, follow these steps to implement it effectively:

- use serena to understand the project structure and conventions
- read the memories related to the issue to gather context
- formulate a plan for the implementation, breaking it down into manageable tasks, write an high-level todolist
- present the plan for review before starting coding, wait for confirmation and approval
- after approval, implement the plan following the todolist created above
- during the implementation, use serena extensively to navigate the codebase, understand existing patterns, etc.
- when done, list the serena memories and evaluate if some need to be updated, or if new ones should be created
