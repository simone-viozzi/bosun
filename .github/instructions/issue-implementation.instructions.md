# Issue Implementation Guidelines

Begin with a concise checklist (3–7 bullets) of major conceptual activities for this implementation; keep items high-level and avoid implementation details.

## Steps for Effective Implementation

1. Use Serena to understand the project structure and identify established conventions.
2. Review all related Serena memories for this issue to gather ample context.
3. Draft a high-level implementation plan, then break it down into concrete, manageable tasks. Build a detailed to-do list based on this breakdown.
4. Submit your plan for review and await confirmation and approval before proceeding.

STOP here and wait for user approval before continuing.

1. Once approved, execute the plan step by step according to your to-do list.
2. Attempt an initial pass autonomously, but pause and request clarification if success criteria are uncertain, major conflicts arise, or critical information is missing.
3. Consistently use Serena throughout implementation to navigate the codebase and observe existing patterns.
4. When finished, list the Serena memories referenced. Review if any require updating or if new memories should be created.

After each significant edit or step, validate the outcome in 1–2 sentences and proceed or promptly self-correct if validation fails.
